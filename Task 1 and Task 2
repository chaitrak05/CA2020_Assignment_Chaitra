Assignment 1

Date :3/29/2020                                                        Ready to review: Yes

TASK ONE: NUMBERS AND VARIABLES
1.	Create three variables in a single line and assign different values to them and make sure their data types are different. Like one is int, another one is float and the last one is a string.
>>> a,b,c=10,15.6,"Chaitra"
>>> type(a)
<type 'int'>
>>> type(b)
<type 'float'>
>>> type(c)
<type 'str'>


2. 	Create a variable of value type complex and swap it with another variable whose value is an integer.
>>> a=1+2j
>>> b=10
>>> a
(1+2j)
>>> a,b=b,a
>>> a
10
>>> b
(1+2j)

3. 	Swap two numbers using the third variable as result name and do the same task without using any third variable.

>>> a=10
>>> b=20
>>> b=a+b
>>> a,b=b,a
>>> print(a,b)
(30, 10)

4. 	Write a program to print the value given by the user by using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.
Version 2
>>> a= raw_input(" Enter your username:")
 Enter your username:Chaitrak10
>>> print a
Chaitrak10
>>> b= raw_input("Enter your password:")
Enter your password:pythonca2020
>>> print b
pythonca2020

Version 3
>>> a=input("Enter your username:")
Enter your username:Chaitrak20
>>> print(a)
Chaitrak20
>>> b=input("Enter your password:")
Enter your password:pythonca2020
>>> print(b)
pythonca2020



5. 	Write a program to complete the task given below:
Ask the user to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 and add both of them to another variable call z.
Use z for adding 30 into it and print the final result by using variable result.
>>> a=int(input("Enter a value between 1-10:"))
Enter a value between 1-10:5
>>> b=int(input("Enter a value between 1-10:"))
Enter a value between 1-10:6
>>> sum= a+b
>>> print(sum)
11
>>> z = sum
>>> print(z)
11
>>> z=z+30
>>> print(z)
41
 print("The final result is :", z)
The final result is : 41
6. 	Write a program to check the data type of the entered values. HINT: Printed output should say -  The input value data type is: int/float/string/etc

>>> a=10
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> print("The input value data type is:", type(a).__name__)
The input value data type is: int
>>> b=20.7
>>> type(b)
<class 'float'>
>>> print("The input value data type is:", type(b).__name__)
The input value data type is:  float
>>> c =1+2j
>>> print("The input value data type is:", type(c).__name__)
The input value data type is: complex
 d="Chaitra"
>>> print("The input value data type is:", type(d).__name__)
The input value data type is: str



7. 	Create Variable using CamelCase, LadderCase and UPPERCASE. (Refer:   https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/) - Variable Conventions to write

>>> newDoc = 'Ladder case'
>>> Newdoc = 'Camelcase'
>>> NEWDOC = 'Upper Case'

8. 	If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value. If Yes then Why?

Yes , because it is dynamically typed .Python does not know the type of variable until the code is run.

If User Enter 2 - Subtraction
If User Enter 3 - Division
If USer Enter 4 - Multiplication
If User Enter 5 - Average
a=30
b=10
print("Enter which operation would you like to perform")
op=input("Choose any of the following operators +, -, *, /, avg :")

result=0
if op=='+':
   result= a+b
elif op=='-':
   result= a-b
elif op=='*':
   result= a*b
elif op=='/':
   result= a/b
elif op=='avg':
 def average(a, b):
  return (a + b) / 2.0
result=average(a,b)

else:
   print("Entered input is not valid")

print(a, op, b ,":", result)

Result:




Ask user to enter the 2 numbers in a variable for first and second for the first 4 options mentioned above.
a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number:"))

print("Enter which operation would you like to perform")
op=input("Choose any of the following operators +, -, *, /, avg :")

result=0
if op=='+':
   result= a+b
elif op=='-':

   result = average(first1,second2)

else:
   print("Entered input is not valid")

print(first1, op, second2 ,"=", result)

Result:

At the end if the answer of any operation is Negative print a statement saying “zsa”
a=int(input("Enter the first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter the second number:"))

print("Enter which operation would you like to perform")
op=input("Choose any of the following operators +, -, *, /, avg :")

    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        break
else:
    print(“error”)


count = 0
while True:
    print(count)

    if count >= 5:
        Break
Result:

7. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
       Expected output: 0 1 2 4 5
Note: Use ‘continue’ statement
for x in range (6):
   if x == 3 or x == 6:
       continue
   else:
       print(x)
   x = x+1

Result:

8.  Write a program that accepts a string as an input from user and calculate the number of digits and letters.
     Expected output: consul12
     Letters 6
     Digits 2
a = str(input("Enter a string:"))
b = 0
c = 0
for i in a:
   if i.isdigit():
       b = b + 1
   else:
       c= c + 1
print("Letters", c)
print("Digits",b)


9. Read the two parts of the question below: 
 Write a program such that it asks users to “guess the lucky number”. If the correct number is guessed the program stops, otherwise it continues forever. 
Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to guess again each time. Use two variables, ‘number’ for the number and ‘answer’ for the answer to the question whether they want to continue guessing. The program stops if the user guesses the correct number or answers “no”. ( The program continues as long as a user has not answered “no” and has not guessed the correct number)
import random

number = random.randint(1, 9)

while True:
   a = int(input("Guess your lucky number:"))
   if a == number:
       print("Good guess")
       answer = str(input("Do you want to guess again: Pres Y for yes and N for No:"))
       if answer == 'Y':
           number = random.randint(1, 9)
       elif answer == 'N':
           break

Result:
Guess your lucky number:1
Guess your lucky number:2
Guess your lucky number:3
Guess your lucky number:4
Guess your lucky number:5
Guess your lucky number:6
Guess your lucky number:7
Good guess
Do you want to guess again: Pres Y for yes and N for No:Y
Guess your lucky number:7
Good guess
Do you want to guess again: Pres Y for yes and N for No:N

10. Write a program that asks five times to guess the lucky number. Use a while loop and a counter, such as
           		counter=1
		While counter <= 5:
			print(“Type in the”, counter, “number”
			counter=counter+1
The program asks for five guesses (no matter whether the correct number was guessed or not). If the correct number is guessed, the program outputs “Good guess!”, otherwise it outputs “Try again!”. After the fifth guess it stops and prints “Game over!”.
import random

number = random.randint(1, 9)
counter = 1
print(number)
while counter <= 5:
   a = int(input("Guess your lucky number:"))

   if counter == 5:
       print("Game Over!")
       break
   else:
       if a == number:
           print("Good guess")
           break
       else:
           print("Try Again!")
   counter += 1

Result:
6
Guess your lucky number:1
Try Again!
Guess your lucky number:2
Try Again!
Guess your lucky number:3
Try Again!
Guess your lucky number:5
Try Again!
Guess your lucky number:9
Game Over!

Process finished with exit code 0


11. In the previous question, insert “break” after the “Good guess!” print statement. “break” will terminate the while loop so that users do not have to continue guessing after they found the number. If the user does not guess the number at all, print “Sorry but that was not very successful”.



Result:
